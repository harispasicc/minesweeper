Minesweeper

Project description:

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game and one of the most popular games, challenging users around the globe to expose all the open areas on the board without hitting bombs for decades. To hit a bomb means to click on it. The player is first presented With a grid containing a number of indistinguishable squares containing a number of pre-specified mines. The number of mines and the size of the grid is decided by the user by selecting a particular difficulty level, according to which a grid
of specified size and number of mines is displayed (the developer generally prespecifes the grid size for each difficulty level) For this project, only one level is expatted to be implemented, containing a 8 x3
board and 64 positions

Project features:
-Board.js: contains grid of the board, mines, win/lost,
-Cell.js: contains cell details such as bomb, flag, colors, reveal
-CreateBoard.js: creating board and making random numbers,
-Lost.js: lost logic,
-reveal.js: statements for revealing,
-StartGame.js: start game page, first page,
-Win.js: win logic,
-App.js: imported board,
-index.js: style of the project

Built with: HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
